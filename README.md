# Intelligent-Traffic-Regulation-System

90% of souls lost on roads is due to rash driving the most common being overspeeding which can be minimized by keeping people accountable and recorded for their crime. In order to tackle and automate this security system at the ground level we have moved in the direction of implementing and executing the automation of the vehicle speed detection system. This paper proposes a new method for determining the speed of a car while simultaneously automating a speed breaker system that will appear when the speed of the car goes above a certain value, also storing the license plate and image of the car in a database. The results show that the proposed electronic system provides a low-cost and efficient for determining the speed of a vehicle and taking the necessary action. The time complexity of the system is less due to the successful interfacing of speed detection and different sensors. Successful implementation of the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is carried out using ESP8266 with an accuracy of 92.69% along with an automated speed breaker.
